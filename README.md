🚕 Cab Booking System (Java Collections Project)
📘 Project Overview

The Cab Booking System is a console-based Java application designed to simulate a simple online cab booking service. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, and modular design, along with the effective use of Java Collections (ArrayList, HashMap) for data storage — without any database integration.

The application allows customers to register, view available cabs, and book rides. Each booking automatically assigns an available cab and driver. Once booked, the cab and driver become unavailable until released (optional cancel feature can be added).
